In this project, we will build a book review application where people can share and find book reviews easily. We will use ReactJS for frontend development and Ruby on Rails for backend development.

With ReactJS, we will build a smart and smooth interface that allows users to easily explore and review books. We can write detailed reviews, give ratings and Ruby on Rails will be the behind-the-scenes superhero taking care of storing data and building API controllers.

We will use the PostgreSQL database for data management and Bootstrap to make our website look user-friendly.
